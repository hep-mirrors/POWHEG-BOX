In order to build the program, first all MadGraph routines must
be built. Do the following:

$ sh ./MakeMad.sh

In order to build a version for debugging,
do

$ sh ./MakeMad.sh -g

and all MadGraph subroutines will have no optimization and debug information.

Then do

$ make

to build the pwhg_main executable.

$ cd  testrun-lhc
$ ../pwhg_main

to run.
