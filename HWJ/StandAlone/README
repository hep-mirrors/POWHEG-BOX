In order for this to work, you need to create a directory
libfiles
and a directory
obj-gfortran
in the process directory.
In general, you need a
obj-$(COMPILER)
directory for each compiler you are using

You also need to install makedepf90.

Copy the files here in the process directory, and execute
$ StandAlone.sh

This should produce a Makefile.deps, to be used for the compilation.
The comments in StandAlone.sh clarify what goes on.
