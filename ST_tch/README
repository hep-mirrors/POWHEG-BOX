checklimits file looks wrong because we are including bornzero dumping factor. Otherwise, OK.

todos:
nlo/pythia analysis missing
onthefly event generation targets missing in makefile

to decide:
how mcnlo code used for check has to appear when we make all public?
how HW and PY local driver files have to be named? With a suffix_ST?
pdf for MC shower: the default one?
how we compile herwig/pythia: better to exclude fpe and trapfpe
