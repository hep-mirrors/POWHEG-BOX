Checks wrt old code:
0) LO, NLO
1) TeV, LHC@10TeV
2) M_V centered on the peak value, within 10 widths in both directions
3) fixed scales, equal to M_V peak value
4) Other parameters as indicated in the report paper

For wmws runs:
0) NLO
1) TeV, LHC@10TeV
2) M_V centered on the peak value, within 20 widths in both directions
3) scales equal to current M_V
4) Other parameters as indicated in the report paper

Notice that in principle, for the wmws, M_V should range from its
minimum to its maximum value, avoiding exact photon pole.
For the Z case, a cut M_V>50 is required. Therefore, generate M_V within
20 widths.
